# TimeScribe

TimeScribe is an Android app designed to boost productivity by seamlessly combining a Pomodoro timer with integrated note-taking capabilities. Whether you're working on focused tasks or managing study sessions, TimeScribe helps you stay organized, manage your time effectively, and capture your thoughts without switching between multiple apps.

## ⏱️ How It Works

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method designed to enhance focus and prevent burnout by breaking your work into short, focused intervals, known as "Pomodoros," followed by brief breaks. Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Set a Timer for a Work Session**:
   - Decide on a task you'd like to focus on and set your timer for a fixed interval, usually **25 minutes**. This period is called a **Pomodoro**.

2. **Work Without Interruptions**:
   - During the Pomodoro, you focus solely on that one task. If something unrelated comes up, jot it down quickly to handle later and continue working.

3. **Take a Short Break**:
   - Once the timer rings, take a **5-minute break**. This allows you to rest your mind and get ready for the next session.

4. **Repeat and Take Longer Breaks**:
   - After completing a few Pomodoros (typically four), take a longer **15-30 minute break**. This helps you recharge before the next set of focused sessions.

TimeScribe takes the classic Pomodoro Technique and supercharges it with built-in note-taking and tracking features to make your sessions more productive:

- **Start a Pomodoro Session**: Set up your preferred **work and break durations**. Tap "Start" to begin focusing on your work. You'll receive notifications when it's time to take a break or start a new session.

- **Take Notes During Sessions**: Sometimes ideas or to-dos pop into your head while you're focused on a task. With TimeScribe, you don't have to lose focus switching between apps—just use the **integrated note-taking feature** to jot down quick notes, thoughts, or reminders during each work interval. All notes are saved and categorized by session, making them easy to find later.

- **Save and Review Session History**: Every Pomodoro you complete is saved, allowing you to **review your past sessions**. TimeScribe's **session history** gives you insights into your productivity, such as how many Pomodoros you completed, the duration of your work sessions, and notes you've taken. You can access your **history tab** at any time to see your progress over days, weeks, or even months.

- **Customizable Settings**: You can easily customize your **work intervals**, **short breaks**, and **long breaks** to suit your workflow. Want shorter bursts of work with frequent breaks, or longer, focused deep work periods? TimeScribe adapts to fit your needs.
